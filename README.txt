Practical Game Programming

This course focuses on game development and design. I built a game called "Space Fighter" that was developed over a series of 4 assignments, adding features and such with each iteration. I learned how to set up a C++ development environment for games, write an interactive game with sound and music, create and use sprites, use data files and multithreading, and develop a plan to market a game.

The game "Space Fighter" has the player take control of a spaceship to fight alien forces in a vertical scrolling shooter. There are 3 main enemy types, each with different movement and attack behaviours. The player controls their ship with the arrow keys and uses the spacebar to fire their weapon. Points are scored for each enemy destroyed. If the player is hit by an enemy ship or enemy fire, their ship will lose health. Once the health reaches 0, the player loses a life. Once the player loses their 3 lives, the game is over. Try and achieve a high score!

This game was developed using Dev C++ and the Allegro library. You will need the Allegro software to be able to run the game.
